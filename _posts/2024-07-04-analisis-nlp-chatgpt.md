Recently I've been curious about the ChatGPT application which has been popular for the past 2 years. ChatGPT is a virtual assistant developed by OpenAI that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand how human communication works daily. It consumes a large set of data text to learn the structure of paragraphs, sentences, words, or even the hidden meaning behind words. Currently, there are 3 different versions of ChatGPT called GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) which basically act as a brain for the ChatGPT, they are:

#### GPT-3.5
This is the default version of ChatGPT and has the lowest capabilites among the other three. This version offer basic responses but is sufficient for daily uses, the minus is that this version is also the least reliable and can't predict nor access informations beyond 2022.

#### GPT-4
This version enhance the accuracy and added the ability to access websites, it's powerful enough to be able to help your daily task with [87.2%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58760-x#:~:text=Compared%20to%20its%20previous%20version,(p%20%3D%200.035)%20respectively.) accuracy compared to the previous version which is GPT-3.5 that has only [47.4%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58760-x#:~:text=Compared%20to%20its%20previous%20version,(p%20%3D%200.035)%20respectively.) accuracy. This version brings a lot to the table but also comes with a cost of 20$ monthly subscribe to OpenAI (plus user) which is a great option depending on what you do.

#### GPT-4o
This is the latest version and better version of GPT-4. It has the same intelligence level of GPT-4 but with faster response, improved capabilities, and better at visual and audio understanding. Moreover, it also supports over than 50 languages which makes it flexible and can be used globally. Currently, this version has limited messages per 3 hours for free user and plus user, the latter however, will have 5x greater message limit than free user. Personally I have been using the free version of ChatGPT for study and revision since OpenAI has given us free usage of this very version.

## Natural Languange Processing (NLP) Analysis
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning to enable computers to understand and communicate with human language.  
In this blog, I will try to use a set of data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishkumarak/chatgpt-reviews-daily-updated) to analyze its sentiment component from people's reviews. It involves several steps:
