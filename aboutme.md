I got this image from the Canva AI picture generator prompt, I chose this image for a reason
1. **The Cat**  
represents boundless curiosity and is also my favorite animal.
3. **The Coins**  
means everything in this world always has pairs just like a coin has two sides  
>"And We created pairs of all things so perhaps you would be mindful." Quran Surah Az-Zariyat 49.
For example, for every hardship comes ease  
>"So, surely with hardship comes ease." Quran Surah Al-Insyirah 5.
5. **Color Blue**  
represent knowledge.
